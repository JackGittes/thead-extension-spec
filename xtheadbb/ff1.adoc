{reg:[
    { bits:  7, name: 0xb, attr: ['custom-0, 32 bit'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rd' },
    { bits:  3, name: 0x1 },

Description::
Finds the first bit with the value of '1' from the highest bit of _rs1_ and writes the index back into register _rd_.
If the highest bit of _rs1_ is '1', the result '0' is returned.
If all the bits in _rs1_ are '0', the result '64' is returned.

Operation::
[source,sail]

for i=xlen..0:
  if reg[rs1][i] == 1:
    break;
reg[rd] = (xlen - 1) - i
