    { bits:  7, name: 0xb, attr: ['custom-0, 32 bit'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rd' },

Description::
Finds the first bit with the value of '0' from the highest bit of _rs1_ and writes the index back into register _rd_.
If the highest bit of _rs1_ is '0', the result '0' is returned.
If all the bits in _rs1_ are '1', `XLEN` is returned.

Operation::

for i=xlen..0:
  if reg[rs1][i] == 0:
